# TextReplacerDictionary
A program for mass replacing multiple Keys with Values, in multiple files. (Currently still WIP)

## Example uses
- Can be used if you're decompiling/deobfuscating code. Sometimes you might see 100s of functions like "func37548_ad" in multiple files, 
but if you know what that function actually does, you could use the app to replace "func37548_ad" (or any other function like that) with an easy to read function name.
And this program can replace more than 1 function name at a time, in more than 1 file, hense "Mass Replacing".
